## 🌟 Key Features

- **Interactive Calculator:** Input custom process details (Name, Arrival Time, Burst Time) to run a live simulation.  
- **Gantt Chart Visualization:** Generates a clear, color-coded Gantt chart showing process execution over time, including preemption and context switches.  
- **Comprehensive Metrics:** Calculates and displays individual and average performance statistics:
  - **Turnaround Time (TAT)**
  - **Waiting Time (WT)**
  - **Response Time (RT)**
  - **Completion Time (CT)**
- **Theory Section:** Includes a dedicated page explaining the SRTF algorithm, its steps, and its advantages/disadvantages.  
- **Modern Design:** Built with pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript, featuring a modern, responsive, and dark-mode friendly UI.
